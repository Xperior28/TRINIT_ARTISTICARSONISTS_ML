ML-03 -> Crop Prediction

<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

- &nbsp; Predicting optimal crop for farmers in a particular region and time
  - &nbsp; Geolocation
      - &nbsp; Soil composition
      - &nbsp; Rainfall
      - &nbsp; Temperature
      - &nbsp; Return of investment
  - &nbsp; Helps farmers save on money and fertilizers and
  avoid dangerous practices of growing crops on same patch of land
  which depletes soil of natural resources

- &nbsp; Objective
  - &nbsp;Dataset = {geolocation, season, price}
  - &nbsp; Predicting the best crop
  - &nbsp; Making UI to interact with ML model
  
  
<h1>Approach</h1>

- &nbsp; Farmer inputs date and place.
- &nbsp; We use different ml models to predict the data conditions depending on the date and location
- &nbsp; Factors being rainfall, humidity, temperature, soil and yield mainly
- &nbsp; Input these values into crop recommendation dataset to get the crops that can grow
- &nbsp; Segregate crops further according to season and soil type
- &nbsp; Finally rank crops according to price and yield
